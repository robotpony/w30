			<p>I have probably removed the page you have requested. I've recently pared down the site a bit, removing old, useless content. It's good to curate things, and filter out the crap. And the page you were looking for was crap.</p>

			<p>I'm not returning a `404` or `30x`, as the content has been removed on purpose. It's not an error, and I want you to know what's up.</p>
